    "1) To clean and preprocess the MovieLens datasets to ensure it is suitable for building a recommendation system.\n",

    "2) To understand the distribution of movie ratings, explore user behavior, and identify patterns in the datasets.\n",

    "3) To investigate and compare collaborative filtering techniques for building the recommendation system, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), user-based and item-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) To implement and evaluate the performance of the collaborative filtering model using appropriate metrics such as RSME and MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) To generate top 5 movie recommendations for a user based on their historical ratings."
